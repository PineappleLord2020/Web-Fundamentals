    <h2>Style Guide</h2>

    <!-- ------------------------Steps 6-9------------------------------ -->

    <h3>Color Palette</h3>
    <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in Canvas then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

    <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below. Replace the href value that is there with yours. Make sure to paste it into both the href value and the content text of the <a> tag -->
    <p>Palette URL:</p>
    <a href="https://coolors.co/ae1011-c42847-eb8f1e-000022-de3c4b"
      target="_blank">https://coolors.co/ae1011-c42847-eb8f1e-000022-de3c4b</a>

    <table class="colors">
      <tr>
        <th>Primary</th>
        <th>Secondary</th>
        <th>Accent 1</th>
        <th>Accent 2</th>
      </tr>
      <!-- Replace the numbers in the boxes below with your hex color codes. Then switch to the site-plan.css file and change your colors there as well. -->
      <tr>
        <td class="primary">[#AE1011]</td>
        <td class="secondary">[#C42847]</td>
        <td class="accent1">[#EB8F1E]</td>
        <td class="accent2">[#000022]</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <!-- ------------------------Steps 10-12------------------------------ -->

    <h3>Typography</h3>
    <!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->

    <h4>
      Heading Font: Comic Sans
      <!-- change this -->
    </h4>
    <h4>
      Paragraph Font: Helvetica
      <!-- change this -->
    </h4>
    <h3>Normal paragraph example</h3>
    <p>
      The best Whitewater Rafting in Colorado, White Water Rafting Company
      offers rafting on the Colorado and Roaring Fork Rivers in Glenwood
      Springs (But that's not why you came to our site, is it?). Since 1974, we have been family owned and operated, rafting the
      Shoshone section of Glenwood Canyon and beyond (Is something we do in our free time when we aren't planning world domination).
    </p>
    <h3>Colored paragraph example</h3>
    <p class="colored">
      Trips vary from mild and great for families, to trips exclusively for
      physically fit and experienced rafters (Along with those that are power hungry and don't care for the environment). No matter what type of river
      adventures you are seeking (Civilized or extremely dangerous), White Water Rafting Company can make it
      happen for you (Given 2 to 3 years).

      <a href="#">Page2</a>
      <a href="#">Contact Us</a>
